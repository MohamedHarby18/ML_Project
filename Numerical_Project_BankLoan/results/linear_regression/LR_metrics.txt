CONFUSION MATRIX RAW COUNTS
--------------------------
True Negatives (Correct Rejection):  891
False Positives (False Alarm):       4
False Negatives (Missed Loan):       72
True Positives (Caught Loan):        33

KEY TAKEAWAY
--------------------------
The model is extremely conservative. It has near-perfect precision (only 4 false alarms), 
but it struggles significantly with recall, missing 72 actual loan customers. 
Outlier capping did not significantly change its behavior.
